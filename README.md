# BlogWebsite
I created a visually appealing and responsive design for the blog website.I have built an Food blog Website and the name of my website is Veggie's fresh restaurant where we provide healthy and fresh food. In the head section, the components are home,about us, service,menu, contact. When you will click any of these components then content will be shown in the remaining screen as well as in the top section there is search bar, so you can search anything. I have given all the menu list of Veggie's fresh restaurant as well as I have also provided few questions and answers related to our website like types of dishes, timing, location etc. I have made an working website where user can enter their name, email and provide their valuable feedback as well as user can also submit that form. In the last section, I have added the location of the restaurant in the graph mode and pagination.
